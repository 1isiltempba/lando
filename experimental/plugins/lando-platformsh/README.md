# Platform.sh Plugin Development Guide

This guide contains information to help onboard developers to work on the [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh) integration. Hereafter referred to as "the plugin".

After reading through it the developer should understand:

* The high level goals of the integration
* The general features roadmap
* How the plugin is structured
* How the plugin modifies the usual lando runtime
* How the project is tested
* How additional services/application containers are added
* How additional tooling is added
* Where framework level overrides live
* The development flow and model

It may also be valuable to review the [user documentation](https://docs.lando.dev/config/platformsh.html) for this integration as that provides a bit of a Specification as Documentation.
